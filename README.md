[Confreaks](http://www.confreaks.com) is a great resource for watching Ruby presentations from conferences around the world; [XBMC](http://www.xbmc.org) is a powerful media player which you can use to enjoy them from the comfort of you sofa.

## Notes

- The Vimeo addon (3.5.4) for XBMC is not currently working. For the time being I found that the modified addon in this post fixed things: http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=81052&pid=1782988#pid1782988.
- This addon has been tested with XBMC Frodo and Gotham Beta 2
- Currently the following Confreaks video formats are supported: downloadable files, YouTube, and Vimeo. Please raise an issue if new formats are added and I'll do my best to add support for them.
